# InfaScout
Project name: InfaScout
The vision: a predictive analytics engine for real estate and urban infrastructure. Think of it as "Moneyball for City Planning"
What it actually does:
-Ingests geospatial data (maps, zoning, traffic flow)
-Uses ML to analyze urban growth patterns
-Predicts where real estate value will spike based on infrastructure development (new roads, utilities, services)

Tech stack: Python, Pandas / GeoPandas for data, Scikit-learn for prediction models, and AWS to host it
